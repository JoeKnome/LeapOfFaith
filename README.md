# LeapOfFaith
A unique runner created entirely in JavaScript.

Currently contains basic architecture for randomly generated terrain tiles which alternate between "safe" grass tiles and "danger tiles" (lava and void). Also has basic box player collisions, though does not yet support multidirectional pushing.

The end goal for Leap of Faith is to create an RPG runner, where you control your party as they traverse levels while simultaneously fighting enemies.
